Ymgyrch (Operation)
=======

Codename: shiny-octo-avenger


A Virtual Machine and/or emulator that supports different architectures and byte code formats.

Planned supported formats
-----------------

### Ymgyrch bytecode file (.ybf)
The native bytecode format. Light and quick, avalable under bytecode/ybf.

Ymgyrch will also contain the assembler / compiler for ymgyrch.


### Self Modifing Test Format (.smtl)
Another native bytecode format. Developed as an experiment for self modifing code.

### Android Dalvik Executable (.dex)
A executable for the Android Dalvik Virutal Machiene. Also light and quick.
Ymgyrch will emulate Dalvik as close as possible.
I hope that Ymgyrch will be able to replace Dalvik.

### Java Bytecode (.class)
Emulation of a java virtual machiene. Might be really fun.

### Arcitecture Specific Executables (.bin, .elf)

Emulation of a normal executable running under any (suppported) architecture.

Planned Architecutres
-----------------

* x86
* JVM
* ARM
